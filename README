This plug-in creates a nice preloader using html5 canvas API to draw the percentage during the page loading. Now it works just with images but I hope soon it will work also with audio and video objects.

TODO

- testing the plug in and find all the bugs
- branching to extend the preload with AUDIO and VIDEO elements
- create more graphic feature with canvas
- try to get the percentage even in the browsers that don't support ajax
- fix the mobile devices's bugs
